        "description": "Today at Comic-Con Experience 2022 in São Paulo, Brazil, Marvel Studios debuted the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, introduced Zoe Saldana, who plays Gamora in the franchise, before delighting the enthusiastic fans with the trailer debut for the highly anticipated upcoming feature film, releasing in U.S. theaters on May 5, 2023. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must rally his team around him to defend the universe and protect one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.",

        "description": "For starters, Ryan Reynolds is very sorry he and the rest of the cast and crew of Marvel Studios' Deadpool 3 had to miss the recent D23 Expo. But, fear not, because they've been working very hard on Deadpool 3! However, Reynolds is also fresh out of ideas for the movie and he truly wants this third outting with the merc with a mouth — and Wade Wilson's first appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — to be something special. Something fans will remember forever. Something to really make Deadpool stand out among the rest. And…Reynolds has got nothing. Well, okay, he has one idea: Hugh Jackman, how'd you like to play Wolverine one last time? As for Jackman's nonchalant answer: 'Yeah, sure, Ryan.'",
